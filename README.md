# Guild Book: DnD Character Sheet Creator and Sharing Tool

Guild Book is a tool designed for Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) enthusiasts. It allows you to create and share character sheets with ease. Each character is presented as a unique page in the guild book, making it easy to navigate and find the information you need.

This project is a proof of concept and was created as part of the internship program. It does not have all the features of a fully-fledged application.
